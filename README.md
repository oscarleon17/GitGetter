# GitGetter
A simple python JSON getter for github user data and repos. Works by using python's Request library, a simple and easy to use HTTP library. Using request's GET
function, we are able to easily extract raw data and convert to json for easier readability.

Simply download the repo or clone the branch and open using your preferred IDE.

Once added to you IDE, using the terminal/console/command prompt, run using python -i main.py.

To terminate, simply follow the on-screen instructions (type quit to exit the app, quit() to exit the python console.)
